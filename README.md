# Optical Character Recognition
This project implements an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) inspired by the guide in The Architecture of Open Source Applications: 500 Lines or Less (https://aosabook.org/en/500L/optical-character-recognition-ocr.html)

## Description
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems can be categorized into various branches, Machine Learning being one of them. ML involves taking data sets to train a machine to identify patterns. The training data sets can be supervised (the expected outcomes/outputs are already specified) or unsupervised (the expected outcomes/outputs are unknown). Various ML techniques are generally used to create OCRs. This OCR has been created by using one of these techniques known as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
